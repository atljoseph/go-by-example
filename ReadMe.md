# What's this?

My `golang` learning journey inspired by the tutorial @ `http://gobyexample.com`.

Gonna start with `gophercises.com` next ... ??


# Run a Specific Example

`cd gobyexample` to change directory to the examples folder.

`go run <FILENAME>`, where filename is the path of a golang file (with extension).

To run the Hello World example, `<FILENAME>` becomes `01-hello-world.go`.

Heck, you can even use `go run g*/01*`! :)
