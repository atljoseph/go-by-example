# Go by Example

My golang learning journey inspired by the tutorial @ gobyexample.com

# Run a Specific Example

`cd examples` to change directory to the examples folder.

`go run <FILENAME>`, where filename is the path of a golang file (with extension).

To run the Hello World example, `<FILENAME>` becomes `01-hello-world.go`.

Heck, you can even use `go run e*/01*`! :)

# `knowledge` folder

- [Common symbols](knowledge/symbols.md)
- [Common keywords](knowledge/keywords.md)
- [Common imports](knowledge/imports.md)
- [Common code structures](knowledge/code.md)
